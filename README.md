# IMBD Clone

This Project is about a mini IMDB clone app in which we can search movies based on OMDB API, with search suggestions. Clicking on a particular movie card opens a new movie page for more info about that movie. On clicking on the Add to favourite button, we can add a movie to the favourites list which is using local storage to store movies and checkout that list on favorite page.
